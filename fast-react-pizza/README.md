# Fast React Pizza

A simple pizza ordering application built with React.

## Application Requirements

[ ] Very simple application, where users can order **one or more pizzas** from a menu.
[ ] Requires **no user account** or **authentication**: users can just input their name before using the app.
[x] The pizza menu can change, so it should be **loaded from an API**.
[ ] Users can add multiple pizzas to a **cart** before ordering.
[ ] Ordering requires the **user's name**, **phone number**, and **address**.
[ ] If possible, **GPS location** should also be provided, to make delivery easier.
[ ] User's can **mark their order as 'priority'** for an additional 20% of the cart price
[ ] Orders are made by **sending a POST request** with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API
[ ] Payments are made on delivery. so **no payment gateway** is required.
[ ] Each order will get a **unique ID** that should be displayed, so the **user can later look up their order** based on the ID.
[ ] Users should be able to mark their order as 'priority' **even after the order has been placed**.
